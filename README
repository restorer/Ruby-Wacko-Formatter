[deprecated]

Format text using WackoWiki syntax:
http://wackowiki.sourceforge.net/doc/Doc/English/Formatting

Instead of regex-parsing (as in original WackoWiki) state machine is used
(which requires more code, but make things easier).

This formatter is writter several years ago, and may not support
modern wacko features.
